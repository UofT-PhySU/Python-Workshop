    "Python is a popular and versatile programming language used for a wide variety of tasks, ranging from software development to data science and machine learning to web development to scientific programming like physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to other languages it has a simple syntax similar to English, making it quite simple to learn. Furthermore, it is an interpreted language, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can be written in any text editor like as Notepad or vim. Your file can then be run in a Python console. Alternatively, you can write Python in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which improves the ease with which you can write/ run code, has a bunch of debugging features, manage large collections of Python files, and so on. These include Spyder, Pycharm, Atom, and so on. In the physics community Spyder is quite popular and used in PHY224, so I'd recommend using that.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will go over the basic functionality of Python, including basic syntax, datatypes, functions, loops and conditionals, working with directories, and reading/ writing data. Basic features of the numpy and matplotlib libraries will also be introduced, most notably the numpy array datatype and basic plotting functions. No previous programming experience is needed!"

    "Sometimes, the `curve_fit` function cannot figure out the coefficients because they are too big or too small. This is because `curve_fit` function finds the parameters of the test function using gradient descent to find values of the parameters that will minimize some error function between the best-fit curve and the data. However, it may find a local minimum in the parameter space which is not a global minimum. As such, the result returned by the `curve_fit` function will be wrong.\n",

    "Fourier transforms are an indespensible tool for physicists, widespread in the fields ranging from quantum mechanics to electrodynamics to optics and signal processing. Most commonly, it allow us to map a function from the time-domain to the frequency-domain, allowing us to visualize the sinusoidal signals which constitute a given curve.\n",

    "Fourier analysis is a method for expressing a function as a sum of periodic components, and for recovering the signal from those components. Mathematically it is continuous, but when we compute it using a computer both the function and its Fourier transform are replaced with discretized counterparts, so the process is called the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The DFT has become a mainstay of numerical computing in part because of a very fast algorithm for computing it, called the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).\n",

    "To do this, we will use the `fft` function from the `scipy.fft` subpackage."
